                    Our application enables users to work with a variety of formats, including Word documents, plain text, JSON, and Excel spreadsheets. We help you take advantage of cross-format data by creating links between them and visualizing the meaning of the texts in a variety of contexts.

                    We use semantic data interpretation to help you gather trends, hone in on specifics, and determine paths forward. Our application allows you to take advantage of this interpretation by producing a wide range of outputs useful to share with friends or use in a report.
